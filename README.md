# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is a website that was created as the first project on CS50W - Project 0

I hope that it's an intuitive design - there isn't much going on really and the
content isn't particularly engaging but the main concepts are there.

Details of the individual files below:-

index.html:
  This is the homepage where you will find a navigation bar (throughout the site also)
  which takes you to the relevant pages.
  The navigation bar will show highlights for the currently selected page.
  The links in the cards will also take you to the relevant pages.
  The cards contain some information about the pages as unordered lists.

gallery.html:
  This contains a gallery with a few pictures of dogs.
  You can use left and right arrows to cycle through the images or the
  buttons on the bottom of the image.

table.html:
  This is two tables with information about dogs. The only reason the tables
  were not combined was to practice using different css selectors and different
  bootstrap classes

about.html:
  A short description of the site and it's purpose.
